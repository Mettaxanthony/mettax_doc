We were also able to network with other industry leaders and learn about the latest trends in the technology sector.

One of the highlights of the event for us was our meeting with the CEO of a major Integrators company in Africa and middle east. We discussed how our solutions can help them to improve their customer service and reduce costs. We are confident that this meeting will lead to a new partnership between our two companies.

We also met with a number of startups who are developing innovative new technologies. We were impressed with their creativity and passion, and we are excited to see what they accomplish in the future.

In addition, we had the pleasure of meeting with Wialon and Pilot, two leading providers of fleet management solutions. We discussed how our solutions can be integrated with theirs to provide our customers with even more powerful and comprehensive fleet management capabilities.
